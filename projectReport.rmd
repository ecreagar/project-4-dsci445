# Introduction - Ethan

## "Expected" metrics

- In sports analytics, "expected" metrics are used to evaluate player or team performance
  - Soccer: Expected goals (xG) $^{[1]}$, expected assists, expected points
  - Basketball: Expected points, expected possession value $^{[2]}$
  - Football: Expected Yards after Catch $^{[3]}$
  
- Many uses for these metrics
  - Compare a player's output to an objective baseline
  - Evaluate a team's performance by eliminating randomness
  
## Expected Yards After Fielding (xYAF)

- Given the current conditions when fielding a punt, how many yards do we expect the punt returner to gain

- Takes into account
  - Punt position
  - Fielding position
  - All defender positions (relative)
  - Punt hang time
  
- Should return an accurate estimate of how many yards the player gains based on these factors

## Data

- NFL 2022 Big Data Bowl 
  - Focuses on Special Teams Plays
  - Contains 19,979 plays from 2018 to 2020
  
- After filtering, we predict based on ~2000 returned punts
